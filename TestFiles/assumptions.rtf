\
If the size of the tuple requested in the input is greater than the number of words in any of the files then we choose the minimum of the total number of words in either of the files.\
for example \
\
File 1 contains 5 words\
File 2 contains 3 words\
and tuple size entered is 4 then we choose 3 as the tuple size.\
\
if the number of arguments entered is more than 4 or less than 3 then the program is exited with a message \'91Invalid number of arguments\'92\
If the value for tuple size is less than or equal to 0 then the function exits with a message : \'91Incorrect value for size of tuple\'92\
\
If the number of arguments is 3 then the tuple size is taken as 3 by default\
